    I should be able to login to RocketSeat platform
    In order to access all my classes

    Background: RocketSeat app must be open
        Given Rocketseat app is open

        When I provide a 'incorrect' 'username'
        And I provide a 'incorrect' 'password'
        Then I should get the 'Incorrect Credentials' message
